Assignment 4 April 10
NOTE: For each of the question, present the logic and analysis as part of (i) theory assignment, email the
typed doc/handwritten (ii) C++ code for practice, email the code on completion. Questions are relatively
easy and can be answered if you have understood my scribe. Work in a group of size 4/5 for both theory
and practice. For all these questions, solutions are available online in some form, pay attention while lifting
the solution.
1. Coin-Change problem: Given denominations d1; d2; : : : ; dk (Ex: Re 100, 500, 2000) and an integer
x, the objective is to return change for x if exists using minimum number of currencies. Present (i)
Greedy Algorithm (ii) Dynamic Programming
2. The above problem with the restriction that the number of di is at most li.
3. Finding Maximum Independent Set in Trees - An independent set is a set of mutually non-adjancet
verties and maximum independent set is a set of maximum size. Present (i) Greedy Algorithm (ii)
Dynamic Programming
4. For Matrix-chain multiplication; present two greedy strategies and for each of them present a counter
example to show that it does not give optimum always. As part of practice, implement the DP given
in scribe.
5. All Pairs Shortest Path - Shortest path between any two given pair of vertices (i) Present a greedy
strategy (ii) Present a DP
6. Implement the DP given in scribe for Knapsack problem.
7. Implement Bellman Ford Algorithm.
